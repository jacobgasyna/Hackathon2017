This project was our pride and joy that we worked on during the 2017 HackIllinois
Competition, it is our gift to not only the Open Source community, but the music community
as well. 

We will continue to work on it in the coming months and maybe even years, and we hope that
since it is open source, other people who may be interested will help contribute as well. 
 
We hope to further improve the quality of this program by allowing things like, tempo
adjustment, dotted notes, triplets, more usable measures and scrolling, notes beyond thirty
second notes, visual and audio cues, app capability, and much more. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at our project.
