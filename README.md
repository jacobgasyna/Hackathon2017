README:

This project was our pride and joy that we worked on during the 2017 HackIllinois
Competition, it is our gift to not only the Open Source community, but the music community
as well. 

We will continue to work on it in the coming months and maybe even years, and we hope that
since it is open source, other people who may be interested will help contribute as well. 
 
We hope to further improve the quality of this program by allowing things like, tempo
adjustment, dotted notes, triplets, more usable measures and scrolling, notes beyond thirty
second notes, visual and audio cues, app capability, and much more. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at our project.

Project Dependencies
 * Tkinter - GUI library (usually comes with python but might not)
 * Pillow - image handling

To use our program, simply open the python file "Jacobspart.py" using your the environment 
of your choice running python3, and as long as you have the required dependencies, when you 
run the program it will open up the GUI.

Once in the GUI, the note buttons on the bottom left are used to place notes on the staff
and there are play,stop/reset, and delete buttons on the bottom right. Press the space bar as the line goes across the staff to practice your rhythm skills, have fun!.
