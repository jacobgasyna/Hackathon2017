Git Requests:

A Pull request will pull several files, however the most important files are inside of the 
icons folder, this holds all of the image documents which are used within the program. The 
"jacobspart.py" python file is the final HackIllinois submission document, and all changes should
be based off of that file. 

Reporting a bug:
When recording a bug, create a document describing the bug and how the bug was found, and open a
an issue on the repository.

The first good bugs to start with would be to fix the stop/reset button from leaving the timing
bar on the screen, and being forced to use the delete button to get rid of it. 

New Feature Requirements:
Check to make sure that the feature you are adding has not already been done, besides that have fun.

Recognition Model:
As more people contribute, they will be added to a list of contributors, and the number of times
that they have contributed will be in that list aswell.
